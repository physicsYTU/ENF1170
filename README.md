C++ ?

C++ is an Efficient and Fast Language
C++ is an advanced language that supports various programming methods like functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming. 
It is a fast language; its compile-time and execution time is faster than other programming languages.

Helps You in Earning Other Programming Languages 

C++ is an intermediate-level language; learning this language will give you a much deeper understanding of programming structure. 
In C++, you have to write, declare, and explain everything in the source code, giving you a deeper knowledge of all the program parts.

Also, the syntax of C, C++, and Java are almost the same, so learning Java and C after C++ will be very easy.

Other languages like Python are much easier to understand because they are almost syntax-free. 
You don't have to specify everything while writing its code, which makes the programming part easy, 
but you don't get the opportunity to learn the logic structure of the program like C++.
Once you have learned the C++ language, then other languages will be easy for you to learn, as your foundation becomes strong.
